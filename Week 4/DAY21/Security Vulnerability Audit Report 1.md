# Security Vulnerability Audit Report

## Application Overview:
The provided Node.js application is a simple web application featuring a login form and a user profile page. It uses Express.js for server-side routing and session management. Key dependencies include `bodyParser` for parsing request bodies, `cookieParser` for handling cookies, and `express-session` for managing user sessions.

## Identified Vulnerabilities:

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

**Vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to insufficient input validation and output encoding.
**Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the username and password fields in the login form.
**Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions, leading to session hijacking, sensitive data theft, or defacement.
**Mitigation:** 
- Sanitize and validate user input on both client and server sides.
- Encode user input before rendering it in HTML to prevent script injection.
- Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate XSS risks further.

### SQL Injection:

**Vulnerability:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks due to direct user input being used in SQL queries.
**Exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the username and password fields to inject SQL queries and potentially bypass authentication or extract sensitive information from the database.
**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, or even complete database compromise.
**Mitigation:** 
- Implement parameterized queries or use ORM libraries like Sequelize to abstract away raw SQL queries.
- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious SQL injection attempts.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):

**Vulnerability:** The application lacks CSRF protection, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
**Exploitation:** Attackers can craft malicious requests that execute unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
**Impact:** CSRF attacks can lead to actions such as changing passwords, transferring funds, or modifying user data without their consent.
**Mitigation:** 
- Implement CSRF tokens along with the use of SameSite cookie attribute to mitigate CSRF risks.
- Ensure that sensitive actions require a CSRF token in the request header.

### Identified Vulnerabilities in the Code:

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:

    - **Vulnerable Code (Unsecured Version)**:
        ```javascript
        app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
          const { username, password } = req.body;
          // Authenticate user (vulnerable code for the challenge)
          if (username === 'admin' && password === 'password') {
            req.session.authenticated = true;
            res.redirect('/profile');
          } else {
            res.send('Invalid username or password');
          }
        });
        ```
        
    - **Description**: The application does not escape or validate user input (`username` and `password`) before using it in the response. This makes the application vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts directly into the response.


2. **SQL Injection**:

    - **Vulnerable Code (Unsecured Version)**:
        ```javascript
        app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
          const { username, password } = req.body;
          // Authenticate user (vulnerable code for the challenge)
          if (username === 'admin' && password === 'password') {
            req.session.authenticated = true;
            res.redirect('/profile');
          } else {
            res.send('Invalid username or password');
          }
        });
        ```
        
    - **Description**: The application directly uses the values of the `username` and `password` fields in a comparison condition. This can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious SQL code, leading to SQL injection attacks.

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:

    - **Vulnerable Code (Unsecured Version)**:
        ```javascript
        app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
          const { username, password } = req.body;
          // Authenticate user (vulnerable code for the challenge)
          if (username === 'admin' && password === 'password') {
            req.session.authenticated = true;
            res.redirect('/profile');
          } else {
            res.send('Invalid username or password');
          }
        });
        ```

    - **Description**: The application does not protect sensitive actions against CSRF attacks by not using CSRF tokens in forms or request headers to validate the authenticity of requests. This exposes authenticated users to risks of unauthorized manipulation of their data.


By adding examples of secure code alongside vulnerable code examples, it's easier to see the differences and understand how vulnerabilities can be mitigated by applying secure coding practices.


## Recommendations for Mitigation:

### XSS Mitigation:

- Implement input validation and output encoding to sanitize user input.
- Use libraries like `sanitize-html` to strip out potentially dangerous HTML and script tags.
- Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources of executable scripts.

    - **Secure Code (Secured Version)**:
        ```javascript
        app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
          const { username, password } = req.body;
          // Secure code (sanitizing user input)
          const sanitizedUsername = sanitize(username); // Example function to sanitize input
          const sanitizedPassword = sanitize(password);
          if (sanitizedUsername === 'admin' && sanitizedPassword === 'password') {
            req.session.authenticated = true;
            res.redirect('/profile');
          } else {
            res.send('Invalid username or password');
          }
        });
        ```

### SQL Injection Mitigation:

- Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent direct insertion of user input into SQL queries.
- Avoid dynamic SQL generation based on user input.
- Implement strict input validation and parameter filtering.

 
    - **Secure Code (Secured Version)**:
        ```javascript
        app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
          const { username, password } = req.body;
          // Secure code (sanitizing user input)
          const sanitizedUsername = sanitize(username); // Example function to sanitize input
          const sanitizedPassword = sanitize(password);
          if (sanitizedUsername === 'admin' && sanitizedPassword === 'password') {
            req.session.authenticated = true;
            res.redirect('/profile');
          } else {
            res.send('Invalid username or password');
          }
        });
        ```

### CSRF Mitigation:

- Generate and validate CSRF tokens for sensitive operations.
- Utilize SameSite cookie attribute to restrict cookie transmission.
- Implement anti-CSRF measures for all state-changing operations, including login, password changes, and profile updates.


    - **Secure Code (Secured Version)**:
        ```javascript
        app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
          const { username, password } = req.body;
          // Secure code (implementing CSRF protection)
          const csrfToken = req.session.csrfToken;
          const submittedToken = req.body.csrfToken;
          if (!csrfToken || csrfToken !== submittedToken) {
            res.status(403).send('CSRF token mismatch');
            return;
          }
          // Continue with login authentication
          // ...
        });
        ```
